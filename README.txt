ShamanChi
============

Displays your Maelstrom Weapon and Lightning Shield stacks using the
monk Chi frame.

For Lightning Shield, the first 2 charges are not displayed, since
there are only 5 Chi orbs.

When you have a full stack of your buff, the orbs will spin; this
animation is part of the default UI, but for some reason Blizzard
doesn't currently use it for monks. To disable this animation, use
the "/shamanchi spin" command. There are currently no other options.

If you are not using the default unit frames, this addon probably
won't work for you.
